### About

I’m a frontend developer working with **React and Next.js**, with hands-on experience building real-world web applications through personal and guided projects.

My focus has been on understanding how modern frontend applications are structured — from component-based architecture to managing server and UI state, handling asynchronous data, and building clear user flows.

I’ve built both **internal management tools** and **customer-facing applications**, working with features such as authentication, data mutations, and responsive interfaces. I value writing clean, understandable code and improving steadily by building complete applications rather than isolated demos.

I’m currently looking for an **entry-level frontend role** where I can work in a real development environment, learn from experienced engineers, and contribute to meaningful products.
